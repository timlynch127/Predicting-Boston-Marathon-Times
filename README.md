# Predicting-Boston-Marathon-Times

The included code and paper were all part of final project for my Introduction to Data Science (STOR320) course taken during the Spring 2020 semester. The project had several components throughout the semester from a proposal to an explanatory data analysis to the final paper. Essentially, the premise of the project was to find a dataset online and use it to produce visualizations, insightful analysis, and predictive models using some of the techniques learned throughout the course. I've included the Rmd file used to clean the data and produce some visualizations, as well as the Rmd file used to produce all of the figures and the models in the final paper. The final paper with all of its output can be found at https://rpubs.com/timlynch/STOR320FinalProject.

The project sets out to determine models to predict a given runner's official Boston Marathon time using only their demographic characterisitics using official Boston Marathon results from 2015-2017, obtained from Kaggle. Ultimately, given the diversity of the field in the Boston Marathon, it proves difficult to find reliable predictive model based on demographic factors alone, so the project also investigates how reliably a runner participating in their 3rd consecutive Boston Marathon's time can be predicted based on their demographics and results from the previous two years. For both situations, a wide range of models are considered, but regularized models, such as ridge regression, LASSO, and elastic net methods, provde to be the most useful.
